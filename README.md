# CoachesSoccerCompanionWeb

This is a project to demonstrate some of the skills learned in the second course of Code Kentucky.

This project leverages some of the classes and functionality built in the first Code Kentucky course.

In this project I've leveraged Entity Framework to create a MVC application with identity managemet leveraging the scaffolding functionality on the Player, Coaches, and Teams Class to allow for easy creation, editing, and deletion.

I've seeded the application for data for both the Player and Coaches class (one of each).

I've demonstrated the structure and use of a unit test - in this case I'm testing a method found in the PositionTime class that isn't otherwise used curretnly.

Additionally I've added an API controller for the players class and customized it to allow the user of the API to select a random player.

There are of couse many other things that I'd like to explore - like the integration of playtime and position (PositionTime) tracking found in my console app, and the integration and use of buttons to trigger this functionality.

I hope to continue building on this knowledge in future projects.
